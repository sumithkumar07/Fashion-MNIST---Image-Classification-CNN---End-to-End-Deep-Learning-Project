Fashion MNIST is a dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of clothing items, making it a popular benchmark for image classification tasks. In an end-to-end deep learning project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the goal is to train a model that accurately classifies these grayscale images into 10 categories, such as sneakers, shirts, and dresses.

The project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Normalizing and reshaping images to make them suitable for CNN input.
2. **Model Building** – Designing a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
3. **Training & Optimization** – Using techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and optimizers such as Adam to enhance model performance.
4. **Evaluation & Deployment** – Testing the model's accuracy, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and deploying it for real-world use.

This project is a great introduction to deep learning and serves as a foundation for tackling more complex image classification tasks! Let me know if you need any specific details.
